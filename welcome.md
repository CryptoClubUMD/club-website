# What is Cryptoclub?
We're a group at UMD interested in discussing revolutionary software, cryptocurrency, encryption, computer security, decentralization, and open source software.

Anyone that is interested in technology regarding open source, cryptography, or computer security is welcome! We have no major, year, or service hour requirements.

## Meetings
We typically meet weekly to discuss news in the world of crypto and any project that we have. Although a large portion of our club is based around project, they are optional and don't hold any academic weight. All communication is done through Slack.

## Want to join or are interested to learn more?
Request an invite to the Slack by emailing jakson-at-protonmail-dot-com
